    Europe had the next highest percentage, with more than a quarter (26%) of the generative AI industry based there.

    The Middle East and North Africa were responsible for just 3% of the global generative AI market in 2022, combined. This was less than half the total of Latin America (8%) – the region with the next lowest market share.
